# Sprint 1: Backend Setup and Initial Implementation

## Objectives (Completed)

- Set up the backend development environment.
- Implement Jira connection and data retrieval (mock implementation).
- Develop the Master Agent and Specialized Agents for data processing.
- Integrate agent logic with OpenAI API to enhance user story descriptions.
- Implement a basic triage system for routing queries to appropriate agents.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Set Up Backend Project Structure**
   - Created the `backend` directory.
   - Initialized the FastAPI application in `main.py`.
   - Defined dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
   - Created a `.env` file for environment variables.

2. **Implement Agent System**
   - Defined the `Agent` class in `agents.py`.
   - Implemented User Interface, Help Center, Pricing, and Technical Support agents.
   - Created a triage system to route queries to appropriate agents.

3. **Integrate with OpenAI API**
   - Set up OpenAI API client with proper authentication.
   - Implemented query processing using OpenAI's language models.

4. **Develop Mock Implementations**
   - Created mock implementations for Jira and Qdrant integrations.

5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Tested the backend application for connectivity and data processing.
   - Updated documentation to reflect the current state of the project.

## Outcomes

- A functional backend application that can process user queries and route them to appropriate agents.
- Successful integration with OpenAI API for generating responses.
- Basic error handling and environment variable management implemented.
- Mock implementations in place for future Jira and Qdrant integrations.

## Next Sprint Planning

### Sprint 2: Frontend Development and Integration Completion

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Design and implement a simple web interface for user interactions.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API.

2. **Jira Integration**
   - Implement actual Jira API integration to fetch real project data.
   - Replace mock Jira functionality with real data processing.

3. **Qdrant Integration**
   - Set up Qdrant client and replace mock implementation.
   - Implement vector search functionality for knowledge base queries.

4. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Develop comprehensive test cases for all components.
   - Refine agent behaviors based on test results.

5. **Documentation Update**
   - Create user guide for the application.
   - Update developer documentation with new integrations and frontend details.

## Notes for Next Sprint

- Consider implementing a more sophisticated routing mechanism for queries.
- Explore options for improving the efficiency of the OpenAI API usage.
- Plan for potential scalability challenges as the application grows.
