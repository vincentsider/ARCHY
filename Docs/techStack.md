# Technology Stack

## Backend

- **Language**: Python
  - **Rationale**: Python offers extensive support for web development and AI integrations, making it ideal for implementing the Swarm logic and interacting with Jira APIs.

- **Framework**: FastAPI
  - **Rationale**: FastAPI is modern, fast, and supports asynchronous operations, which is beneficial for handling multiple agent communications efficiently.

## Frontend

- **Language**: JavaScript

- **Framework**: React.js
  - **Rationale**: React.js is a widely used library for building dynamic user interfaces, allowing for rapid development and a rich user experience.

## Swarm Logic

- **Tool**: OpenAI's Swarm Framework
  - **Rationale**: To implement the agent collaboration as per OpenAI's Swarm principles, facilitating communication between the Master Agent and specialized agents.

## Database

- **Type**: SQLite (for MVP)
  - **Rationale**: SQLite is lightweight and requires minimal setup, suitable for an MVP. It allows for quick development without the overhead of managing a full-scale database system.

## Environment Management

- **Tool**: Docker
  - **Rationale**: Containerization ensures consistent development and deployment environments, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.

## Other Tools

- **Jira Integration**: Jira REST API
  - **Rationale**: To connect to Jira and perform necessary operations like retrieving and updating epics, stories, and subtasks.

- **Environment Variables Management**: Python `dotenv` package
