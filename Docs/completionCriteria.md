# Completion Criteria

## Project Goals

- **Jira Integration**: Successfully connect to Jira using environment variables (`JIRA_HOST`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `PROJECT_KEY`).

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieve the Jira project structure, including epics, stories, and subtasks, formatted as specified.

- **Master Agent Implementation**:
  - Develop a Master Agent that acts as a lead business analyst.
  - Orchestrate discussions among specialized agents.
  - Aggregate responses to optimize and clarify subtask descriptions.

- **Specialized Agents Development**:
  - Create domain-specific agents (e.g., customer support, finance, product experts).
  - Each agent contributes sector-specific knowledge to refine user stories.

- **Swarm Collaboration**:
  - Implement agent collaboration following OpenAI's Swarm principles.
  - Ensure meaningful contributions from each agent to simulate real-world consulting.

- **User Story Enhancement**:
  - Update each user story and subtask to be detailed, actionable, and unambiguous.
  - Refine descriptions with sector-specific terminology and clarity.

- **Data Synchronization**:
  - Save the refined descriptions back to the Jira project.
  - Ensure updates are accurately reflected within the system.

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - All environment variables are easily accessible and modifiable via a `.env` file.
  - Implement secure handling of sensitive information.

## Key Features

1. **Secure Jira Connection**:
   - Utilize the Jira REST API for secure communication.
   - Handle authentication using environment variables.

2. **Dynamic Data Handling**:
   - Efficiently parse and structure data retrieved from Jira.
   - Support for scalable data manipulation as the project grows.

3. **Agent Communication Framework**:
   - Establish protocols for interaction between the Master Agent and specialized agents.
   - Ensure asynchronous communication for efficiency.

4. **Modular Codebase**:
   - Write clean, maintainable code with proper documentation.
   - Implement modularity for ease of future enhancements.

5. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging for monitoring processes.
   - Robust error handling to manage exceptions and API failures.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear instructions for setup and deployment.
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation for all modules.

7. **Testing Suite**:
   - Develop tests for critical components to ensure reliability.
   - Include unit tests for agents and integration tests for the overall system.

## Success Criteria

- **Functional Connectivity**: The application connects to Jira and retrieves data without errors.

- **Effective Collaboration**: Agents interact seamlessly, and the Master Agent successfully refines user stories.

- **Quality Enhancement**: User stories are significantly improved, meeting clarity and precision standards.

- **Data Integrity**: Updated descriptions are correctly saved back to Jira, matching the intended modifications.

- **User Configuration**: Users can easily modify environment variables as needed.

- **Scalability**: The system can handle an increasing number of agents and Jira items without performance degradation.
