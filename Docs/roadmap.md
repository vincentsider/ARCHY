# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the high-level timeline and milestones for developing the MVP web application that integrates OpenAI's Swarm framework with Jira to enhance and clarify user story descriptions.

## Timeline and Milestones

### Week 1: Environment Setup and Jira Integration

- **Objective**: Establish the development environment and connect to Jira.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up the project structure and version control.
  - Configure Docker for environment management.
  - Create a `.env` file for managing environment variables (`JIRA_HOST`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `PROJECT_KEY`).
  - Implement connection to Jira using the Jira REST API.
  - Retrieve and parse Jira data, including epics, stories, and subtasks.

### Week 2: Develop Master Agent and Basic Specialized Agents

- **Objective**: Implement the core agents and establish communication protocols.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop the Master Agent acting as the lead business analyst.
  - Create initial specialized agents (e.g., customer support, finance, product experts).
  - Define and implement communication protocols following OpenAI's Swarm principles.
  - Ensure agents can interact and exchange information effectively.

### Week 3: Enhance Agent Functionalities and User Story Refinement

- **Objective**: Improve agents with sector-specific knowledge and refine the logic for user story enhancement.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate sector-specific data and expertise into specialized agents.
  - Develop algorithms for the Master Agent to aggregate and optimize agent responses.
  - Implement logic to enhance and clarify user story descriptions.
  - Begin iterative testing of agent interactions and outputs.

### Week 4: Data Synchronization and System Testing

- **Objective**: Implement updating of refined descriptions back to Jira and conduct comprehensive testing.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop functionality to save updated user stories and subtasks back to the Jira project.
  - Ensure data integrity and accurate synchronization with Jira.
  - Conduct unit testing for individual components.
  - Perform integration testing for the entire system.
  - Identify and resolve any bugs or issues.

### Week 5: Optimization, Documentation, and Deployment Preparation

- **Objective**: Optimize system performance, finalize documentation, and prepare for deployment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Optimize code for performance and scalability.
  - Implement logging and robust error handling mechanisms.
  - Complete all project documentation, including setup and deployment guides.
  - Prepare Docker configurations for deployment.
  - Conduct a final review and make necessary refinements.

## Post-MVP Considerations

- **User Interface Development**: Plan for a frontend interface using React.js to allow user interactions with the system.
- **Advanced Security Measures**: Implement enhanced authentication and security protocols for production environments.
- **Scalability Planning**: Consider migrating to a more robust database system if needed.
- **Feature Expansion**: Add more specialized agents and functionalities based on user feedback and project requirements.
