# Project Overview

This project is an MVP web application that involves designing an OpenAI Swarm-based application where a Master Agent, emulating a lead business analyst, connects to a Jira project, extracts epics, stories, and subtasks, and collaborates with a swarm of specialized agents to enhance and clarify user story descriptions. The aim is to refine these descriptions with sector-specific knowledge, ensuring clarity and precision for developers to build accurately based on client expectations.

## Complexity Level

MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Current Stage

Backend Implementation Complete

## Completed Tasks

- Set up the project structure
- Implemented the backend using FastAPI
- Created multiple specialized agents (User Interface, Help Center, Pricing, Technical Support)
- Implemented a triage system to route queries to appropriate agents
- Integrated OpenAI API for generating responses
- Implemented basic error handling and environment variable management
- Created a mock implementation for Qdrant integration (to be replaced with actual integration later)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Design and implement a simple web interface for user interactions
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend API

2. **Jira Integration**:
   - Implement actual Jira API integration to fetch real project data

3. **Qdrant Integration**:
   - Replace the mock Qdrant implementation with actual Qdrant client integration

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Develop comprehensive test cases for all components
   - Refine agent behaviors based on test results

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update all documentation to reflect the current state of the project
   - Create user and developer guides

## Notes

- The current implementation uses a simplified triage system. Consider implementing a more sophisticated routing mechanism in the future.
- The OpenAI API key is now properly loaded from the environment variables.
- The system successfully routes queries to different agents based on the content.
- Mock implementations are in place for some functionalities (e.g., Qdrant integration) and will need to be replaced with actual implementations in future iterations.
