Here's a quick breakdown:\n\n1. **Technical Requirements**: We need to define how the login will be managed, such as using traditional email/password, social login options, or two-factor authentication. There should be clarity on the authentication protocols and technologies to be used.\n\n2. **User Experience**: The login process should be intuitive and seamless, minimizing user effort while ensuring security. This covers elements like design, flow, and guidance for error scenarios.\n\n3. **Quality Assurance**: It's important to define how the login process will be tested, including edge cases like incorrect password attempts, password recovery, and account lockout mechanisms.\n\n4. **Stakeholder Liaison**: Understanding and integrating any specific business rules or compliance requirements related to user authentication and data storage.\n\nI will now involve the specialized agents in parallel to provide their inputs on this user story.",

Consider providing users with guidance on creating strong passwords.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Configure user-friendly error messages for incorrect login attempts, avoiding disclosure of sensitive information.\n   - Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\n5. **User Interface**:\n   - Design a responsive and intuitive login interface that accommodates different devices and screen sizes.\n   - Include options for \"Remember Me,\" \"Forgot Password,\" and potentially social media login buttons.\n\n6. **Session Management**:\n   - Implement session controls, managing session timeout, and providing options for manual logout.\n   - Ensure that session tokens are securely stored and transmitted.\n\nThese requirements should be considered to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly login mechanism for the application.
