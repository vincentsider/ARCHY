Here are the key technical components to consider:\n\n1. **User Interface (UI) Requirements**:\n   - A login page that includes fields for entering a username and password.\n   - A 'Submit' or 'Login' button to initiate the login process.\n   - Optional: A link for password recovery and registration if not yet a user.\n\n2. **Authentication Process**:\n   - Server-side validation of user credentials against stored data.\n   - Password hashing and verification to ensure secure password storage and matching.\n   - Implement a session mechanism to maintain user login status.\n\n3. **Security Requirements**:\n   - Use HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.\n   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.\n   - CAPTCHA integration to mitigate automated login attempts.\n   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional security layer.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Display user-friendly error messages for login failures.\n   - Handle incorrect username or password scenarios gracefully.\n   - Log failed login attempts for security monitoring.\n\n5. **Database Requirements**:\n   - A user database table to store user credentials and relevant information.\n   - Indexing on username for efficient search and retrieval.\n\n6. **API & Backend Logic**:\n   - An endpoint for users to submit login credentials.\n   - Logic for authenticating user credentials and returning a session token or identifier.\n\n7. **Testing Requirements**:\n   - Unit and integration tests for the authentication process.\n   - Security testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities in the login process.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Detailed design and prototype of the login UI.\n- Select authentication libraries or frameworks that fulfill the security and authentication requirements.\n- Develop and test the login feature following these technical requirements. \n\nIf you need further explanation or additional features, please let me know!",
