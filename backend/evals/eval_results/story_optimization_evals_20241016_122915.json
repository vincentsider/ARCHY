Ensure cookies are marked with Secure and HttpOnly attributes.\n- **Timeout Settings**: Define session timeout settings to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity.\n\n### Scalability & Performance\n- **Load Management**: Ensure the login mechanism can handle predicted user loads. This could involve load balancing and failover strategies.\n- **Latency Optimization**: Minimize latency especially in database queries involved in the authentication process.\n\n### Integration\n- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: If SSO is preferred, integrate with centralized authentication providers (like OAuth or SAML).\n- **Social Logins**: If applicable, support logging in through third-party providers like Google, Facebook, etc.\n\nBy focusing on these requirements, we can ensure that the login functionality is secure, robust, and user-friendly.
