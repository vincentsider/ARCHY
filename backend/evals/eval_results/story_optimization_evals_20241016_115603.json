Here are the technical requirements based on the user story:\n\n1. **User Authentication**: Implement a user authentication system to verify the identity of the user trying to log in.\n   \n2. **User Interface**: Design and implement a user interface that allows users to enter their credentials (username and password) for logging in.\n\n3. **Secure Password Storage**: Ensure passwords are securely stored using techniques like hashing and salting to protect user confidentiality.\n\n4. **Session Management**: Implement session management to maintain the user's authentication status during their session.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages for incorrect login attempts to guide users on how to proceed.\n\nLet's break down these requirements further and ensure they are clear and detailed."
